# bert-base-finetuned-squad2

## Model description

This model is based on **[bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)** and was finetuned on **[SQuAD2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)**. The corresponding papers you can found [here (model)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and [here (data)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822).


## How to use

```python
from transformers.pipelines import pipeline

model_name = "phiyodr/bert-base-finetuned-squad2"
nlp = pipeline('question-answering', model=model_name, tokenizer=model_name)
inputs = {
    'question': 'What discipline did Winkelmann create?',
    'context': 'Johann Joachim Winckelmann was a German art historian and archaeologist. He was a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the difference between Greek, Greco-Roman and Roman art. "The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology", Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art. '
}
nlp(inputs)
```
