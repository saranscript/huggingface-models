- trained for one epoch with deepspeed
- used the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset parsed into a chat transcript structure
- model is too big for inference API, but you can test it in a colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/pszemraj/c4307c24750838e92f98b70851f50ae9/scratchpad.ipynb)
