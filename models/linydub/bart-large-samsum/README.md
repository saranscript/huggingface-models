    Henry: Hey, is Nate coming over to watch the movie tonight?
    Kevin: Yea, he said he'll be arriving a bit later at around 7 since he gets off of work at 6. Have you taken out the garbage yet?
    Henry: Oh I forgot. I'll do that once I'm finished with my assignment for my math class.
    Kevin: Yea, you should take it out as soon as possible. And also, Nate is bringing his girlfriend.
    Henry: Nice, I'm really looking forward to seeing them again.

## `bart-large-samsum`
This model was trained using Microsoft's [`Azure Machine Learning Service`](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning). It was fine-tuned on the [`samsum`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) corpus from [`facebook/bart-large`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large) checkpoint.

## Usage (Inference)
```python
from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="linydub/bart-large-samsum")

input_text = '''
