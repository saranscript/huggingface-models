from the heat. Set aside for 1/2 an hour to infuse. Added flavour can be released by pressing down
on the rosemary leaves with a spoon. Add the pieces to the blender or food processor with the
elderflower cordial. Blend or process to a purée.,, Add the lemon or lime juice and stir to
combine., Add a cover and place in the freezer.After 2 hours, remove from the freezer and break up
with a fork. This helps the ice crystals to form properly.Continue doing this every hour until the
granita freezes properly. Scoop the granita into dessert bowls and serve. Garnish with a cucumber
curl or a small sprig of rosemary."

# Model name
Wikihow T5-small

## Model description

This is a T5-small model trained on Wikihow All data set. The model was trained for 3 epochs using a batch size of 16 and learning rate of 3e-4. Max_input_lngth is set as 512 and max_output_length is 150. Model attained a Rouge1 score of 31.2 and RougeL score of 24.5. 
We have written a blog post that covers the training procedure. Please find it [here](https://medium.com/@priya.dwivedi/fine-tuning-a-t5-transformer-for-any-summarization-task-82334c64c81).
