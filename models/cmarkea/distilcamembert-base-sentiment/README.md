DistilCamemBERT-Sentiment
=========================

We present DistilCamemBERT-Sentiment which is [DistilCamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base) fine tuned for the sentiment analysis task for the French language. This model is constructed over 2 datasets: [Amazon Reviews](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon_reviews_multi) and [Allociné.fr](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allocine) in order to minimize the bias. Indeed, Amazon reviews are very similar in the messages and relatively shorts, contrary to Allociné critics which are long and rich texts.

This modelization is close to [tblard/tf-allocine](https://huggingface.co/tblard/tf-allocine) based on [CamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base) model. The problem of the modelizations based on CamemBERT is at the scaling moment, for the production phase for example. Indeed, inference cost can be a technological issue. To counteract this effect, we propose this modelization which **divides the inference time by 2** with the same consumption power thanks to [DistilCamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base).

Dataset
-------

The dataset is composed of 204,993 reviews for training and 4,999 reviews for the test coming from Amazon, and respectively 235,516 and 4,729 critics from [Allocine website](https://www.allocine.fr/). The dataset is labeled into 5 categories:
* 1 star: represents a very bad appreciation,
* 2 stars: bad appreciation,
* 3 stars: neutral appreciation,
* 4 stars: good appreciation,
* 5 stars: very good appreciation. 
 
Evaluation results
------------------

In addition of accuracy (called here *exact accuracy*) in order to be robust to +/-1 star estimation errors, we will take the following definition as a performance measure:

$$\mathrm{top\!-\!2\; acc}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{O}|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{O}}\sum_{0\leq l < 2}\mathbb{1}(\hat{f}_{i,l}=y_i)$$

where \\(\hat{f}_l\\) is the l-th largest predicted label, \\(y\\) the true label, \\(\mathcal{O}\\) is the test set of the observations and \\(\mathbb{1}\\) is the indicator function.

| **class**   | **exact accuracy (%)** | **top-2 acc (%)** | **support** |
| :---------: | :--------------------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
| **global**  | 61.01                  | 88.80             | 9,698       | 
| **1 star**  | 87.21                  | 77.17             | 1,905       |
| **2 stars** | 79.19                  | 84.75             | 1,935       |
| **3 stars** | 77.85                  | 78.98             | 1,974       |
| **4 stars** | 78.61                  | 90.22             | 1,952       |
| **5 stars** | 85.96                  | 82.92             | 1,932       |

Benchmark
---------

This model is compared to 3 reference models (see below). As each model doesn't have the same definition of targets, we detail the performance measure used for each of them. For the mean inference time measure, an **AMD Ryzen 5 4500U @ 2.3GHz with 6 cores** was used.

#### bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment
[nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) is based on BERT model in the multilingual and uncased version. This sentiment analyzer is trained on Amazon reviews similarly to our model, hence the targets and their definitions are the same.

| **model** | **time (ms)** | **exact accuracy (%)** | **top-2 acc (%)** |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :--------------------: | :---------------: |
| [cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment) | **95.56** | **61.01** | **88.80** |
| [nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) | 187.70 | 54.41 | 82.82 |

#### tf-allociné and barthez-sentiment-classification
[tblard/tf-allocine](https://huggingface.co/tblard/tf-allocine) based on [CamemBERT](https://huggingface.co/camembert-base) model and [moussaKam/barthez-sentiment-classification](https://huggingface.co/moussaKam/barthez-sentiment-classification) based on [BARThez](https://huggingface.co/moussaKam/barthez) use the same bi-class definition between them. To bring this back to a two-class problem, we will only consider the *"1 star"* and *"2 stars"* labels for the *negative* sentiments and *"4 stars"* and *"5 stars"* for *positive* sentiments. We exclude the *"3 stars"* which can be interpreted as a *neutral* class. In this context, the problem of +/-1 star estimation errors disappears. Then we use only the classical accuracy definition.

| **model** | **time (ms)** | **exact accuracy (%)** |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :--------------------: |
| [cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment](https://huggingface.co/cmarkea/distilcamembert-base-sentiment) | **95.56** | **97.52** |
| [tblard/tf-allocine](https://huggingface.co/tblard/tf-allocine) | 329.74 | 95.69 |
| [moussaKam/barthez-sentiment-classification](https://huggingface.co/moussaKam/barthez-sentiment-classification) | 197.95 | 94.29 |
