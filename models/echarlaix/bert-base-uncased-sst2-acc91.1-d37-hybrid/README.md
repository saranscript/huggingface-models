## bert-base-uncased model fine-tuned on SST-2

This model was created using the [nn_pruning](https://github.com/huggingface/nn_pruning) python library: the linear layers contains **37%** of the original  weights.

The model contains **51%** of the original weights **overall** (the embeddings account for a significant part of the model, and they are not pruned by this method).

In terms of perfomance, its **accuracy** is **91.17**.

## Fine-Pruning details
This model was fine-tuned from the HuggingFace [model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) checkpoint on task, and distilled from the model [textattack/bert-base-uncased-SST-2](https://huggingface.co/textattack/bert-base-uncased-SST-2).
This model is case-insensitive: it does not make a difference between english and English.

A side-effect of the block pruning method is that some of the attention heads are completely removed: 88 heads were removed on a total of 144 (61.1%).
Here is a detailed view on how the remaining heads are distributed in the network after pruning.
