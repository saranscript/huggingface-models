# t5-base-japanese-web (with Byte-fallback, 32K)

## Description

[megagonlabs/t5-base-japanese-web](https://huggingface.co/megagonlabs/t5-base-japanese-web) is a T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model pre-trained on Japanese web texts.  
Training codes are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/megagonlabs/t5-japanese).

The vocabulary size of this model is 32K.
[8K version is also available](https://huggingface.co/megagonlabs/t5-base-japanese-web-8k).

### Corpora

We used following corpora for pre-training.

- Japanese in [mC4/3.0.1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4) (We used [Tensorflow native format](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5056))
    - 87,425,304 pages
    - 782 GB in TFRecord format
- [Japanese](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wiki40b#wiki40bja) in [wiki40b/1.3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wiki40b)
    - 828,236 articles (2,073,584 examples)
    - 2 GB in TFRecord format

### Tokenizer

We used Japanese Wikipedia to train [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).

- Vocabulary size: 32,000
- [Byte-fallback](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/releases/tag/v0.1.9): Enabled

### Parameters

- T5 model: [models/t5.1.1.base.gin](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/t5/models/gin/models/t5.1.1.base.gin)
- Training steps: 1,000,000

It took about 126 hours with TPU v3-8
