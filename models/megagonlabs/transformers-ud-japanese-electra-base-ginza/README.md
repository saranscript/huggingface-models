# transformers-ud-japanese-electra-ginza (sudachitra-wordpiece, mC4 Japanese)

This is an [ELECTRA](https://github.com/google-research/electra) model pretrained on approximately 200M Japanese sentences extracted from the [mC4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4) and finetuned by [spaCy v3](https://spacy.io/usage/v3) on [UD\_Japanese\_BCCWJ r2.8](https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/ja_bccwj/index.html).

The base pretrain model is [megagonlabs/transformers-ud-japanese-electra-base-discrimininator](https://huggingface.co/megagonlabs/transformers-ud-japanese-electra-base-discriminator), which requires [SudachiTra](https://github.com/WorksApplications/SudachiTra) for tokenization.

The entire spaCy v3 model is distributed as a python package named [`ja_ginza_electra`](https://pypi.org/project/ja-ginza-electra/) from PyPI along with [`GiNZA v5`](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza) which provides some custom pipeline components to recognize the Japanese bunsetu-phrase structures.
Try running it as follows:
```console
$ pip install ginza ja-ginza-electra
$ ginza
```
