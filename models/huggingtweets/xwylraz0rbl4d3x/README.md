I was made with [huggingtweets](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets).

Create your own bot based on your favorite user with [the demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/borisdayma/huggingtweets/blob/master/huggingtweets-demo.ipynb)!

## How does it work?

The model uses the following pipeline.

![pipeline](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets/blob/master/img/pipeline.png?raw=true)

To understand how the model was developed, check the [W&B report](https://wandb.ai/wandb/huggingtweets/reports/HuggingTweets-Train-a-Model-to-Generate-Tweets--VmlldzoxMTY5MjI).

## Training data

The model was trained on [@xwylraz0rbl4d3x's tweets](https://twitter.com/xwylraz0rbl4d3x).

| Data | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Tweets downloaded | 3152 |
| Retweets | 682 |
| Short tweets | 631 |
| Tweets kept | 1839 |

[Explore the data](https://wandb.ai/wandb/huggingtweets/runs/36q46b23/artifacts), which is tracked with [W&B artifacts](https://docs.wandb.com/artifacts) at every step of the pipeline.

## Training procedure

The model is based on a pre-trained [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) which is fine-tuned on @xwylraz0rbl4d3x's tweets.

Hyperparameters and metrics are recorded in the [W&B training run](https://wandb.ai/wandb/huggingtweets/runs/3a0sqgtk) for full transparency and reproducibility.

At the end of training, [the final model](https://wandb.ai/wandb/huggingtweets/runs/3a0sqgtk/artifacts) is logged and versioned.

## How to use

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation',
                     model='huggingtweets/xwylraz0rbl4d3x')
generator("My dream is", num_return_sequences=5)
```

## Limitations and bias

The model suffers from [the same limitations and bias as GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2#limitations-and-bias).

In addition, the data present in the user's tweets further affects the text generated by the model.
