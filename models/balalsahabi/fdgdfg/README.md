The most intriguing storyline for this fight is the belt itself that is on the line. Pacquiao won the Super version of the WBA’s welterweight title in July 2019 when he beat Keith Thurman in a split decision. The WBA stripped Pacquiao of the title this past January due to inactivity. The organizing body then promoted Ugas into the Super belt. Ugas won the WBA’s Regular title in September 2020 when he beat Abel Ramos in a split decision.

That means Ugas won a title last held by Pacquiao without having to beat Pacquiao. Pacquiao-Spence would have been a significantly bigger fight for welterweight supremacy, but this is still interesting. Pacquiao was an underdog against Spence, but comes into this fight as a -360 favorite at DraftKings Sportsbook.
