I was made with [huggingartists](https://github.com/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists).

Create your own bot based on your favorite artist with [the demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlekseyKorshuk/huggingartists/blob/master/huggingartists-demo.ipynb)!

## How does it work?

To understand how the model was developed, check the [W&B report](https://wandb.ai/huggingartists/huggingartists/reportlist).

## Training data

The model was trained on lyrics from Тони Раут (Tony Raut) & Гарри Топор (Garry Topor).

Dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingartists/tony-raut-and-garry-topor).
And can be used with:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("huggingartists/tony-raut-and-garry-topor")
```

[Explore the data](https://wandb.ai/huggingartists/huggingartists/runs/xnzxet17/artifacts), which is tracked with [W&B artifacts](https://docs.wandb.com/artifacts) at every step of the pipeline.

## Training procedure

The model is based on a pre-trained [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) which is fine-tuned on Тони Раут (Tony Raut) & Гарри Топор (Garry Topor)'s lyrics.

Hyperparameters and metrics are recorded in the [W&B training run](https://wandb.ai/huggingartists/huggingartists/runs/tfby1rj2) for full transparency and reproducibility.

At the end of training, [the final model](https://wandb.ai/huggingartists/huggingartists/runs/tfby1rj2/artifacts) is logged and versioned.

## How to use

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation',
                     model='huggingartists/tony-raut-and-garry-topor')
generator("I am", num_return_sequences=5)
```

Or with Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead
  
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("huggingartists/tony-raut-and-garry-topor")

model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("huggingartists/tony-raut-and-garry-topor")
```

## Limitations and bias

The model suffers from [the same limitations and bias as GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2#limitations-and-bias).

In addition, the data present in the user's tweets further affects the text generated by the model.
