## Title Generator
References this [notebook](https://shivanandroy.com/transformers-generating-arxiv-papers-title-from-abstracts/)

Using `t5-small`, trained on a batch size of 16 for 4 epochs, utilising the ArXiV dataset through the `SimpleTransformers` library. Around 15k data was used for training and 3.7k data for evaluation.

This is a `.pkl` file.

### Prerequisites
Install `simpletransformers` library.
```bsh
pip install simpletransformers
```

### Example Usage
```py
import pickle

model = pickle.load(open("title-generator-t5-arxiv-16-4.pkl", "rb"))
