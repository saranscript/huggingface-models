# Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53-Hindi-Marathi
Fine-tuned facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53 on Hindi and Marathi using the OpenSLR SLR64 datasets. When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz.

## Installation 
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git datasets librosa torch==1.7.0 torchaudio==0.7.0 jiwer
```

## Eval dataset:
```bash
wget https://www.openslr.org/resources/103/Marathi_test.zip  -P data/marathi
unzip -P "K3[2?do9" data/marathi/Marathi_test.zip -d data/marathi/.
tar -xzf data/marathi/Marathi_test.tar.gz -C data/marathi/.
wget https://www.openslr.org/resources/103/Hindi_test.zip  -P data/hindi
unzip -P "w9I2{3B*" data/hindi/Hindi_test.zip -d data/hindi/.
tar -xzf data/hindi/Hindi_test.tar.gz -C data/hindi/.
wget  -O test.csv 'https://filebin.net/snrz6bt13usv8w2e/test_large.csv?t=ps3n99ho'
#If download does not work, paste this link in browser: https://filebin.net/snrz6bt13usv8w2e/test_large.csv
```
## Usage
 The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows, assuming you have a dataset with Marathi text and path fields:



```python
import torch
import torchaudio
import librosa
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor

from datasets import load_metric, Dataset
from transformers import Wav2Vec2Processor, Wav2Vec2ForCTC

wer = load_metric("wer")
processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained('tanmaylaud/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-hindi-marathi')
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained('tanmaylaud/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-hindi-marathi').to("cuda")

# Preprocessing the datasets.
# We need to read the audio files as arrays
def speech_file_to_array_fn(batch):
    batch["sentence"] = re.sub(chars_to_ignore_regex, '', batch["sentence"])
    speech_array, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load(batch["path"])
    batch["speech"] = speech_array[0].numpy()
    batch["sampling_rate"] = sampling_rate
    batch["target_text"] = batch["sentence"]
    batch["speech"] = librosa.resample(np.asarray(batch["speech"]), sampling_rate, 16_000)
    batch["sampling_rate"] = 16_000
    return batch

test_data= test_data.map(speech_file_to_array_fn)
inputs = processor(test_data["speech"][:2], sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(inputs.input_values, attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask).logits

predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

print("Prediction:", processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids))
print("Reference:", test_data["text"][:2])
```
