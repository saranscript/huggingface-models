# CORe Model - BioBERT + Clinical Outcome Pre-Training

## Model description

The CORe (_Clinical Outcome Representations_) model is introduced in the paper [Clinical Outcome Predictions from Admission Notes using Self-Supervised Knowledge Integration](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.75.pdf).
It is based on BioBERT and further pre-trained on clinical notes, disease descriptions and medical articles with a specialised _Clinical Outcome Pre-Training_ objective.

#### How to use CORe

You can load the model via the transformers library:
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bvanaken/CORe-clinical-outcome-biobert-v1")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bvanaken/CORe-clinical-outcome-biobert-v1")
```
From there, you can fine-tune it on clinical tasks that benefit from patient outcome knowledge.

### Pre-Training Data

The model is based on [BioBERT](https://huggingface.co/dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1) pre-trained on PubMed data.
The _Clinical Outcome Pre-Training_ included discharge summaries from the MIMIC III training set (specified [here](https://github.com/bvanaken/clinical-outcome-prediction/blob/master/tasks/mimic_train.csv)), medical transcriptions from [MTSamples](https://mtsamples.com/) and clinical notes from the i2b2 challenges 2006-2012. It  further includes ~10k case reports from PubMed Central (PMC), disease articles from Wikipedia and article sections from the [MedQuAd](https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD) dataset extracted from NIH websites.
