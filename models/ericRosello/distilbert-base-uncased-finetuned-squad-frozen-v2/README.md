# distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-squad

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the squad dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 1.2104

## Model description

Most base model weights were frozen leaving only to finetune the last layer (qa outputs) and 3 last layers of the encoder.
