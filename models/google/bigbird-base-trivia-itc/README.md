# BigBird base trivia-itc

This model is a fine-tune checkpoint of `bigbird-roberta-base`, fine-tuned on `trivia_qa` with `BigBirdForQuestionAnsweringHead` on its top.

Check out [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DVOm1VHjW0eKCayFq1N2GpY6GR9M4tJP?usp=sharing) to see how well `google/bigbird-base-trivia-itc` performs on question answering.

## How to use

Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:

```python
from transformers import BigBirdForQuestionAnswering

# by default its in `block_sparse` mode with num_random_blocks=3, block_size=64
model = BigBirdForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-base-trivia-itc")

# you can change `attention_type` to full attention like this:
model = BigBirdForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-base-trivia-itc", attention_type="original_full")

# you can change `block_size` & `num_random_blocks` like this:
model = BigBirdForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-base-trivia-itc", block_size=16, num_random_blocks=2)

question = "Replace me by any text you'd like."
context = "Put some context for answering"
encoded_input = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors='pt')
output = model(**encoded_input)
```

# Fine-tuning config & hyper-parameters
