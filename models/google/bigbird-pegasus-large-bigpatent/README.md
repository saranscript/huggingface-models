# BigBirdPegasus model (large)

BigBird, is a sparse-attention based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle. 

BigBird was introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14062) and first released in this [repository](https://github.com/google-research/bigbird).

Disclaimer: The team releasing BigBird did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

BigBird relies on **block sparse attention** instead of normal attention (i.e. BERT's attention) and can handle sequences up to a length of 4096 at a much lower compute cost compared to BERT. It has achieved SOTA on various tasks involving very long sequences such as long documents summarization, question-answering with long contexts.

## How to use

Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:

```python
from transformers import BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent")

# by default encoder-attention is `block_sparse` with num_random_blocks=3, block_size=64
model = BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent")

# decoder attention type can't be changed & will be "original_full"
# you can change `attention_type` (encoder only) to full attention like this:
model = BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent", attention_type="original_full")

# you can change `block_size` & `num_random_blocks` like this:
model = BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent", block_size=16, num_random_blocks=2)

text = "Replace me by any text you'd like."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
prediction = model.generate(**inputs)
prediction = tokenizer.batch_decode(prediction)
```

## Training Procedure

This checkpoint is obtained after fine-tuning `BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration` for **summarization** on [big_patent](https://huggingface.co/datasets/big_patent) dataset.
