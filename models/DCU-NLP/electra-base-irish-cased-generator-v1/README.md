# gaELECTRA
[gaELECTRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12930) is an ELECTRA model trained on 7.9M Irish sentences. For more details, including the hyperparameters and pretraining corpora used please refer to our paper. For fine-tuning this model on a token classification task, e.g. Named Entity Recognition, use the discriminator model.

### Limitations and bias
Some data used to pretrain gaBERT was scraped from the web which potentially contains ethically problematic text (bias, hate, adult content, etc.). Consequently, downstream tasks/applications using gaBERT should be thoroughly tested with respect to ethical considerations.


### BibTeX entry and citation info
