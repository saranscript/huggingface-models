# About
These are the pretrained weights for [this](https://github.com/matthias-wright/flaxmodels/tree/main/flaxmodels/resnet) ResNet implementation in Jax/Flax. The weights are taken from [this](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py) repository. 

# Documentation
[Here](https://github.com/matthias-wright/flaxmodels/blob/main/docs/Documentation.md#1-checkpoints) is a documentation that explains the preprocessing steps as well as the format of the pretrained weights.
