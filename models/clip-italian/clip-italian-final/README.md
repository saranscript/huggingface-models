# CLIP-Italian
CLIP Italian is a CLIP-like Model for Italian. The CLIP model (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training) was developed by researchers at OpenAI and is able to efficiently learn visual concepts from natural language supervision. 

We fine-tuned a competitive Italian CLIP model with only ~1.4 million Italian image-text pairs. This model is part of the [Flax/Jax Community Week](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-community-week-using-jax-flax-for-nlp-cv/7104), organized by [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and TPU usage sponsored by Google.

## Training Data
We considered three main sources of data: 
- [WIT](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wit)
- [MSCOCO-IT](https://github.com/crux82/mscoco-it)
- [Conceptual Captions](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions/)
