**Deprecation Notice**  
This model is deprecated. New Filipino Transformer models trained with a much larger corpora are available.  
Use [`jcblaise/roberta-tagalog-base`](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise/roberta-tagalog-base) or [`jcblaise/roberta-tagalog-large`](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise/roberta-tagalog-large) instead for better performance.

# BERT Tagalog Base Uncased (Whole Word Masking)
Tagalog version of BERT trained on a large preprocessed text corpus scraped and sourced from the internet. This model is part of a larger research project. We open-source the model to allow greater usage within the Filipino NLP community. This particular version uses whole word masking.
