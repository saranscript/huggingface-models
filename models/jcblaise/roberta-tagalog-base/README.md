# RoBERTa Tagalog Base
Tagalog RoBERTa trained as an improvement over our previous Tagalog pretrained Transformers. Trained with TLUnified, a newer, larger, more topically-varied pretraining corpus for Filipino. This model is part of a larger research project. We open-source the model to allow greater usage within the Filipino NLP community.

This model is a cased model. We do not release uncased RoBERTa models.
