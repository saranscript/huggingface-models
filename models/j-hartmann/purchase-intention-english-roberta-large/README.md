This RoBERTa-based model can classify *expressed purchase intentions* in English language text in 2 classes:

- purchase intention ü§©
- no purchase intention üòê

The model was fine-tuned on 2,000 manually annotated social media posts. 
The hold-out accuracy is 95% (vs. a balanced 50% random-chance baseline). 
For details on the training approach see Web Appendix F in Hartmann et al. (2021). 

# Application

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="j-hartmann/purchase-intention-english-roberta-large", return_all_scores=True)
classifier("I want this!")
```

```python
Output:
[[{'label': 'no', 'score': 0.0014553926885128021},
  {'label': 'yes', 'score': 0.9985445737838745}]]
```
