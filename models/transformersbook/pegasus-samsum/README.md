# pegasus-samsum-test

This model is a fine-tuned version of [google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail) on the samsum dataset. The model is trained in Chapter 6: Summarization in the [NLP with Transformers book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). You can find the full code in the accompanying [Github repository](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/06_summarization.ipynb).

It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 1.4875
