This model was trained on the [CLINC150](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02027) dataset for customer intent detection. The dataset can be found on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/clinc_oos). The model is used in Chapter 8: Making Transformers Efficient in Production in the [NLP with Transformers book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/). You can find the full code in the accompanying [Github repository](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/08_model-compression.ipynb).
