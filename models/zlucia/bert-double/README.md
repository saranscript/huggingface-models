### BERT (double)
Model and tokenizer files for BERT (double) model from [When Does Pretraining Help? Assessing Self-Supervised Learning for Law and the CaseHOLD Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08671).

### Training Data
BERT (double) is pretrained using the same English Wikipedia corpus that the base BERT model (uncased, 110M parameters), [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased), was pretrained on. For more information on the pretraining corpus, refer to the [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper.

### Training Objective
This model is initialized with the base BERT model (uncased, 110M parameters), [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased), and trained for an additional 1M steps on the MLM and NSP objective. 

This facilitates a direct comparison to our BERT-based models for the legal domain, which are also pretrained for 2M total steps.
- Legal-BERT: zlucia/legalbert (https://huggingface.co/zlucia/legalbert)
- Custom Legal-BERT: zlucia/custom-legalbert (https://huggingface.co/zlucia/custom-legalbert)

### Usage
Please see the [casehold repository](https://github.com/reglab/casehold) for scripts that support computing pretrain loss and finetuning on BERT (double) for classification and multiple choice tasks described in the paper: Overruling, Terms of Service, CaseHOLD.

See `demo.ipynb` in the casehold repository for details on calculating domain specificity (DS) scores for tasks or task examples by taking the difference in pretrain loss on BERT (double) and Legal-BERT. DS score may be readily extended to estimate domain specificity of tasks in other domains using BERT (double) and existing pretrained models (e.g., [SciBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676)).
