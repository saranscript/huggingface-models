###  Legal-BERT
Model and tokenizer files for Legal-BERT model from [When Does Pretraining Help? Assessing Self-Supervised Learning for Law and the CaseHOLD Dataset of 53,000+ Legal Holdings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08671).

### Training Data
The pretraining corpus was constructed by ingesting the entire Harvard Law case corpus from 1965 to the present (https://case.law/). The size of this corpus (37GB) is substantial, representing 3,446,187 legal decisions across all federal and state courts, and is larger than the size of the BookCorpus/Wikipedia corpus originally used to train BERT (15GB).

### Training Objective
This model is initialized with the base BERT model (uncased, 110M parameters), [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased), and trained for an additional 1M steps on the MLM and NSP objective, with tokenization and sentence segmentation adapted for legal text (cf. the paper).

### Usage
Please see the [casehold repository](https://github.com/reglab/casehold) for scripts that support computing pretrain loss and finetuning on Legal-BERT for classification and multiple choice tasks described in the paper: Overruling, Terms of Service, CaseHOLD.
