Using the [DistilRoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/distilroberta-base) model as starting point, the ClimateBERT Language Model is additionally pretrained on a text corpus comprising climate-related research paper abstracts, corporate and general news and reports from companies. The underlying methodology can be found in our [language model research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12010).
