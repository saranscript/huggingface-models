## Model description

LayoutLM is a simple but effective pre-training method of text and layout for document image understanding and information extraction tasks, such as form understanding and receipt understanding. LayoutLM archives the SOTA results on multiple datasets. For more details, please refer to our paper:

## Different Tokenizer
Note that LayoutLM-Cased requires a different tokenizer, based on RobertaTokenizer. You can
initialize it as follows:

~~~
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('microsoft/layoutlm-base-cased') 
~~~
