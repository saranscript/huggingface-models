    Henry: Hey, is Nate coming over to watch the movie tonight?
    Kevin: Yea, he said he'll be arriving a bit later at around 7 since he gets off of work at 6. Have you taken out the garbage yet? It's starting to make the kitchen really smell.
    Henry: Oh I forgot. I'll do that once I'm finished with my assignment for my math class.
    Kevin: Yea, you should take it out as soon as possible. And also, Nate is bringing his girlfriend too.
    Henry: Nice, I'm really looking forward to seeing them again.

## `t5-3b-samsum-deepspeed`
This model was trained using Microsoft's `AzureML` and `DeepSpeed`'s ZeRO 2 optimization. It was fine-tuned on the `SAMSum` corpus from `t5-3b` checkpoint.

More information on the fine-tuning process (includes samples and benchmarks):  
*(currently still WIP, updates coming soon: 7/6/21~7/9/21)*

## Resource Usage
These results are retrieved from AzureML Studio's resource monitoring module. All experiments were ran on AzureML's low priority clusters.

| key | value |
| --- | ----- |
| AzureML SKU | ND40rs_v2 (8 X V100 32GB) |
| Region | US West 2 |
| Run Duration | 43m 51.05s |
| Compute Cost (LowPriority/Dedicated) | $3.22/$16.10 (USD) |
| Average CPU Utilization | 46.0% |
| Average GPU Utilization | 56.9% |
| GPU Memory Usage (Avg/Peak) | 26.77/30.49 (GB) |
| Total GPU Energy Usage | 2448.69 (kJ) |

*Compute cost is calculated from run duration and SKU's price per hour. Updated SKU pricing could be found here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/machine-learning/  
*Peak memory usage is calculated from average peak across all utilized GPUs.  

### Carbon Emissions
These results are obtained using `codecarbon`. The carbon emission is estimated from training runtime only (excluding setup and evaluation runtime).
