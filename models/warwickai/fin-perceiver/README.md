# FINPerceiver
FINPerceiver is a fine-tuned Perceiver IO language model for financial sentiment analysis.
More details on the training process of this model are available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/warwickai/fin-perceiver).

Weights & Biases was used to track experiments.

We achieved the following results with 10-fold cross validation.

```
eval/accuracy  0.8624 (stdev 0.01922)
eval/f1        0.8416 (stdev 0.03738)
eval/loss      0.4314 (stdev 0.05295)
eval/precision 0.8438 (stdev 0.02938)
eval/recall    0.8415 (stdev 0.04458)
```

The hyperparameters used are as follows.

```
per_device_train_batch_size  16
per_device_eval_batch_size   16
num_train_epochs             4
learning_rate                2e-5
```

## Datasets
This model was trained on the Financial PhraseBank (>= 50% agreement)
