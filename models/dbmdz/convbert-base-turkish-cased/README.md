# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz Turkish ConvBERT model

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources a cased ConvBERT model for Turkish üéâ

# üáπüá∑ ConvBERTurk

ConvBERTurk is a community-driven cased ConvBERT model for Turkish.

In addition to the BERT and ELECTRA based models, we also trained a ConvBERT model. The ConvBERT architecture is presented
in the ["ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02496) paper.

We follow a different training procedure: instead of using a two-phase approach, that pre-trains the model for 90% with 128
sequence length and 10% with 512 sequence length, we pre-train the model with 512 sequence length for 1M steps on a v3-32 TPU.

## Stats

The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence
segmented version of the Turkish [OSCAR corpus](https://traces1.inria.fr/oscar/),
a recent Wikipedia dump, various [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) and a
special corpus provided by [Kemal Oflazer](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/).

The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens.

Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we could train a cased model
on a TPU v3-32!

## Usage

With Transformers >= 4.3 our cased ConvBERT model can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "dbmdz/convbert-base-turkish-cased"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
