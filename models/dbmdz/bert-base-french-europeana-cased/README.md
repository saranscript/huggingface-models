# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz BERT model

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources French Europeana BERT models üéâ

# French Europeana BERT

We extracted all French texts using the `language` metadata attribute from the Europeana corpus.

The resulting corpus has a size of 63GB and consists of 11,052,528,456 tokens.

Based on the metadata information, texts from the 18th - 20th century are mainly included in the
training corpus.

Detailed information about the data and pretraining steps can be found in
[this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/europeana-bert).

## Model weights

BERT model weights for PyTorch and TensorFlow are available.

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.3 our French Europeana BERT model can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-french-europeana-cased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("dbmdz/bert-base-french-europeana-cased")
```

# Huggingface model hub

All models are available on the [Huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz).
