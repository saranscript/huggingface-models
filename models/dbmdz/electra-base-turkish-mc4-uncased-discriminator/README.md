We present community-driven BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA and ConvBERT models for Turkish 🎉

Some datasets used for pretraining and evaluation are contributed from the
awesome Turkish NLP community, as well as the decision for the BERT model name: BERTurk.

# Stats

We've also trained an ELECTRA (uncased) model on the recently released Turkish part of the
[multiligual C4 (mC4) corpus](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/discussions/5265) from the AI2 team.

After filtering documents with a broken encoding, the training corpus has a size of 242GB resulting
in 31,240,963,926 tokens.

We used the original 32k vocab (instead of creating a new one).

# mC4 ELECTRA

In addition to the ELEC**TR**A base cased model, we also trained an ELECTRA uncased model on the Turkish part of the mC4 corpus. We use a
sequence length of 512 over the full training time and train the model for 1M steps on a v3-32 TPU.

# Model usage

All trained models can be used from the [DBMDZ](https://github.com/dbmdz) Hugging Face [model hub page](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz)
using their model name.

Example usage with 🤗/Transformers:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("electra-base-turkish-mc4-uncased-discriminator")

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("electra-base-turkish-mc4-uncased-discriminator")
```
