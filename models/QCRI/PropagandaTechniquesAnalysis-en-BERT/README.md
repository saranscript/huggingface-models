Propaganda Techniques Analysis BERT
----

This model is a BERT based model to make predictions of propaganda techniques in
news articles in English. The model is described in
[this paper](https://propaganda.qcri.org/papers/EMNLP_2019__Fine_Grained_Propaganda_Detection.pdf).


## Model description

Please find propaganda definition here:

### How to use

```python
>>> from transformers import BertTokenizerFast
>>> from .model import BertForTokenAndSequenceJointClassification
>>>
>>> tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')
>>> model = BertForTokenAndSequenceJointClassification.from_pretrained(
>>>     "QCRI/PropagandaTechniquesAnalysis-en-BERT",
>>>     revision="v0.1.0",
>>> )
>>> 
>>> inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)
>>> sequence_class_index = torch.argmax(outputs.sequence_logits, dim=-1)
>>> sequence_class = model.sequence_tags[sequence_class_index[0]]
>>> token_class_index = torch.argmax(outputs.token_logits, dim=-1)
>>> tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs.input_ids[0][1:-1])
>>> tags = [model.token_tags[i] for i in token_class_index[0].tolist()[1:-1]]
```

Previous work has addressed propaganda detection at document level, typically labelling all articles from a propagandistic news outlet as propaganda. Such noisy gold labels inevitably affect the quality of any learning system trained on them. A further issue with most existing systems is the lack of explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel task: performing fine-grained analysis of texts by detecting all fragments that contain propaganda techniques as well as their type. In particular, we create a corpus of news articles manually annotated at fragment level with eighteen propaganda techniques and propose a suitable evaluation measure. We further design a novel multi-granularity neural network, and we show that it outperforms several strong BERT-based baselines.",
