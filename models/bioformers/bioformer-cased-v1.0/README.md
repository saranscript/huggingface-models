Bioformer is a lightweight BERT model for biomedical text mining. Bioformer uses a biomedical vocabulary and is pre-trained from scratch only on biomedical domain corpora. Our experiments show that Bioformer is 3x as fast as BERT-base, and achieves comparable or even better performance than BioBERT/PubMedBERT on downstream NLP tasks.

Bioformer has 8 layers (transformer blocks) with a hidden embedding size of 512, and the number of self-attention heads is 8. Its total number of parameters is 42,820,610.

## Vocabulary of Bioformer
Bioformer uses a cased WordPiece vocabulary trained from a biomedical corpus, which included all PubMed abstracts (33 million, as of Feb 1, 2021) and 1 million PMC full-text articles. PMC has 3.6 million articles but we down-sampled them to 1 million such that the total size of PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles are approximately equal. To mitigate the out-of-vocabulary issue and include special symbols (e.g. male and female symbols) in biomedical literature, we trained Bioformerâ€™s vocabulary from the Unicode text of the two resources. The vocabulary size of Bioformer is 32768 (2^15), which is similar to that of the original BERT.

## Pre-training of Bioformer
Bioformer was pre-trained from scratch on the same corpus as the vocabulary (33 million PubMed abstracts + 1 million PMC full-text articles). For the masked language modeling (MLM) objective, we used whole-word masking with a masking rate of 15%. There are debates on whether the next sentence prediction (NSP) objective could improve the performance on downstream tasks. We include it in our pre-training experiment in case the prediction of the next sentence is needed by end-users. Sentence segmentation of all training text was performed using [SciSpacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/).

Pre-training of Bioformer was performed on a single Cloud TPU device (TPUv2, 8 cores, 8GB memory per core). The maximum input sequence length was fixed to 512, and the batch size was set to 256. We pre-trained Bioformer for 2 million steps, which took about 8.3 days.


## Awards
