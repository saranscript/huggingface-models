This model is a demonstration of the [Ernie library] (https://github.com/labteral/ernie) for fine-tuning sentence classification models. The base model is bert-base-uncased. The dataset for fine-tuning consists of two labeled example sentences. Because this is a toy example, we do not recommend it for anything other than for demonstrating the Ernie integration with Huggingface Hub.
