# BERT base model (uncased)
Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and first released in
[this repository](https://github.com/google-research/bert). This model is uncased: it does not make a difference
between english and English.
Disclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by
the Hugging Face team.
