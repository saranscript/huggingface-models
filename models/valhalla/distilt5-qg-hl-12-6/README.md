## DistilT5 for question-generation
This is distilled version of [t5-base-qg-hl](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/t5-base-qg-hl) model trained for answer aware question generation task. The answer spans are highlighted within the text with special highlight tokens.

The model is distilled using the **No Teacher Distillation** method proposed by Huggingface, [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/seq2seq#distilbart).

We just copy alternating layers from `t5-base-qg-hl` and finetune more on the same data. Following table lists other distilled models and their metrics.

You can play with the model using the inference API, just highlight the answer spans with `<hl>` tokens. For example

`<hl> 42 <hl> is the answer to life, the universe and everything.`

nlp("42 is the answer to life, universe and everything.")
=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?'}]
