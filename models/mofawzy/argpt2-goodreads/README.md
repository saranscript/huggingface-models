# argpt2-goodreads

This model is a fine-tuned version of [gpt2-medium](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-medium) on an goodreads LABR  dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 1.4389

## Model description

Generate sentences either positive/negative examples based on goodreads corpus in arabic language.

## Intended uses & limitations

the model fine-tuned on arabic language only with aspect to generate sentences such as reviews in order todo the same for other languages you need to fine-tune it in your own.
any harmful content generated by GPT2 should not be used in anywhere.

## Training and evaluation data
training and validation done on goodreads dataset LABR 80% for trainng and 20% for testing
## Usage

```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mofawzy/argpt2-goodreads")

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mofawzy/argpt2-goodreads")

```
