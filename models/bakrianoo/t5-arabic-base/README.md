## Arabic T5 Base Model

A customized T5 Model for Arabic and English Task. It could be used as an alternative for `google/mt5-base` model, as it's much smaller and only targets Arabic and English based tasks.

### About T5

```
T5 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which each task is converted into a text-to-text format.

The T5 model was presented in Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu.
