# RoBERTa base model

Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) and first released in
[this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta). This model is case-sensitive: it
makes a difference between english and English.

Disclaimer: The team releasing RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by
the Hugging Face team.
