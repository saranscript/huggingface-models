# T5-small for paraphrase generation

Google's T5-small fine-tuned on [Quora Question Pairs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/quora) dataset for paraphrasing.

## Model in Action ðŸš€

```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("hetpandya/t5-small-quora")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("hetpandya/t5-small-quora")

def get_paraphrases(sentence, prefix="paraphrase: ", n_predictions=5, top_k=120, max_length=256,device="cpu"):
        text = prefix + sentence + " </s>"
        encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text, pad_to_max_length=True, return_tensors="pt"
        )
        input_ids, attention_masks = encoding["input_ids"].to(device), encoding[
            "attention_mask"
        ].to(device)

        model_output = model.generate(
            input_ids=input_ids,
            attention_mask=attention_masks,
            do_sample=True,
            max_length=max_length,
            top_k=top_k,
            top_p=0.98,
            early_stopping=True,
            num_return_sequences=n_predictions,
        )

        outputs = []
        for output in model_output:
            generated_sent = tokenizer.decode(
                output, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True
            )
            if (
                generated_sent.lower() != sentence.lower()
                and generated_sent not in outputs
            ):
                outputs.append(generated_sent)
        return outputs

paraphrases = get_paraphrases("The house will be cleaned by me every Saturday.")

for sent in paraphrases:
  print(sent)
```

## Output
```
My house is up clean on Saturday morning. Thank you for this email. I'm introducing a new name and name. I'm running my house at home. I'm a taller myself. I'm gonna go with it on Monday. (the house will be up cleaned).
Is there anything that will be cleaned every Saturday morning?
The house is clean and will be cleaned each Saturday by my wife.
I will clean the house for almost a week. I have to clean it all the weekend. I will be able to do it. My house is new.
If I clean my house every Monday, I can call it clean.
