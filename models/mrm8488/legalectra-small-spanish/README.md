## LEGALECTRA ⚖️

**LEGALECTRA** (small) is an Electra like model (discriminator in this case) trained on [A collection of corpora of Spanish legal domain](https://zenodo.org/record/5495529#.YZItp3vMLJw).

As mentioned in the original [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB):
**ELECTRA** is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. It can be used to pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. ELECTRA models are trained to distinguish "real" input tokens vs "fake" input tokens generated by another neural network, similar to the discriminator of a [GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). At small scale, ELECTRA achieves strong results even when trained on a single GPU. At large scale, ELECTRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset.

For a detailed description and experimental results, please refer the paper [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB).


## Training details

The model was trained using the Electra base code for 3 days on 1 Tesla V100 16GB.
