This is the model used for knowledge cluster classification for the DSTC10 track2 knowledge selection task, trained with double heads, i.e., classifier head and LM head using ASR error simulator for model training.

For further information, please refer to https://github.com/yctam/dstc10_track2_task2 for the Github repository. You can use this model and use our source code to predict knowledge clusters under ASR errors.
