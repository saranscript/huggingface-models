This checkpoint is obtained after training `FlaxBigBirdForQuestionAnswering` (with extra pooler head) on [`natural_questions`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/natural_questions) dataset on TPU v3-8. This dataset takes around ~100 GB on disk. But thanks to Cloud TPUs and Jax, each epoch took just 4.5 hours. Script for training can be found here: https://github.com/vasudevgupta7/bigbird

**Use this model just like any other model from ðŸ¤—Transformers**

```python
from transformers import FlaxBigBirdForQuestionAnswering, BigBirdTokenizerFast

model_id = "vasudevgupta/flax-bigbird-natural-questions"
model = BigBirdForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = BigBirdTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(model_id)
```

In case you are interested in predicting category (null, long, short, yes, no) as well, use `FlaxBigBirdForNaturalQuestions` (instead of `FlaxBigBirdForQuestionAnswering`) from my training script.
