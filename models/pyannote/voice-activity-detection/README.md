# ðŸŽ¹ Voice activity detection

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.0 currently in development: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop#installation).

```python
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/voice-activity-detection")
output = pipeline("audio.wav")

for speech in output.get_timeline().support():
    # active speech between speech.start and speech.end
    ...
```
