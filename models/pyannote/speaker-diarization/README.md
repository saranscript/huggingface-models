# ðŸŽ¹ Speaker diarization

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.0 currently in development: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop#installation).

```python
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization")
output = pipeline("audio.wav")

for turn, _, speaker in output.itertracks(yield_label=True):
    # speaker speaks between turn.start and turn.end
    ...
```
