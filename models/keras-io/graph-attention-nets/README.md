## Background Information 
Graph neural networks is the preferred neural network architecture for processing data structured as graphs (for example, social networks or molecule structures), yielding better results than fully-connected networks or convolutional networks.

This tutorial implements a specific graph neural network known as a [Graph Attention Network (GAT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) to predict labels of scientific papers based on the papers they cite (using the [Cora dataset](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data)).
