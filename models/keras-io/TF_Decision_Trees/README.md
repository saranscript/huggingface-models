# Classification with TensorFlow Decision Forests 

#### Using TensorFlow Decision Forests for structured data classification
 <br />

##### This example uses Gradient Boosted Trees model in binary classification of structured data, and covers the following scenarios:


1. Build a decision forests model by specifying the input feature usage.

2. Implement a custom Binary Target encoder as a Keras Preprocessing layer to encode the categorical features with respect to their target value co-occurrences, and then use the encoded features to build a decision forests model.

The example uses Tensorflow 7.0 or higher. It uses the US Census Income Dataset containing approximately 300k instances with 41 numerical and categorical variables. This is a binary classification problem to determine whether a person makes over 50k a year.
