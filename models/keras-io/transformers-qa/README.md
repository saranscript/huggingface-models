# Question Answering with Hugging Face Transformers and Keras ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-cased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased) on SQuAD dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Train Loss: 0.9300
- Validation Loss: 1.1437
- Epoch: 1

## Model description

Question answering model based on distilbert-base-cased, trained with ü§óTransformers + ‚ù§Ô∏èKeras.

## Intended uses & limitations

This model is trained for Question Answering tutorial for Keras.io.

## Training and evaluation data
