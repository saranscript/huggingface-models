# WMT 21 En-X
WMT 21 En-X is a 4.7B multilingual encoder-decoder (seq-to-seq) model trained for one-to-many multilingual translation.
It was introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03265) and first released in [this](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wmt21) repository.

The model can directly translate English text into 7 other languages: Hausa (ha), Icelandic (is), Japanese (ja), Czech (cs), Russian (ru), Chinese (zh), German (de).

To translate into a target language, the target language id is forced as the first generated token.
To force the target language id as the first generated token, pass the `forced_bos_token_id` parameter to the `generate` method.

*Note: `M2M100Tokenizer` depends on `sentencepiece`, so make sure to install it before running the example.*

To install `sentencepiece` run `pip install sentencepiece`

Since the model was trained with domain tags, you should prepend them to the input as well.
* "wmtdata newsdomain": Use for sentences in the news domain
* "wmtdata otherdomain": Use for sentences in all other domain

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-x")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wmt21-dense-24-wide-en-x")

inputs = tokenizer("wmtdata newsdomain One model for many languages.", return_tensors="pt")

# translate English to German
generated_tokens = model.generate(**inputs, forced_bos_token_id=tokenizer.get_lang_id("de"))
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
# => "Ein Modell für viele Sprachen."

# translate English to Icelandic
generated_tokens = model.generate(**inputs, forced_bos_token_id=tokenizer.get_lang_id("is"))
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
# => "Ein fyrirmynd fyrir mörg tungumál."
```
