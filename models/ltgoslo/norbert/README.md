NorBERT was trained as a part of NorLM, a joint initiative of the projects [EOSC-Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) (European Open Science Cloud) and [SANT](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/sant/index.html) (Sentiment Analysis for Norwegian),
coordinated by the [Language Technology Group](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) (LTG) at the University of Oslo.

The computations were performed on resources provided by UNINETT Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway.
