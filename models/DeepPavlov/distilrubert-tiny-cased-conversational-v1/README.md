# distilrubert-tiny-cased-conversational
Conversational DistilRuBERT-tiny \(Russian, cased, 3‑layers, 264‑hidden, 12‑heads, 11.8M parameters\) was trained on OpenSubtitles\[1\], [Dirty](https://d3.ru/), [Pikabu](https://pikabu.ru/), and a Social Media segment of Taiga corpus\[2\] (as [Conversational RuBERT](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-conversational)). It can be considered as tiny copy of [Conversational DistilRuBERT-small](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/distilrubert-tiny-cased-conversational).


Our DistilRuBERT-tiny is highly inspired by \[3\], \[4\] and architecture is very close to \[5\]. Namely, we use 
* MLM loss (between token labels and student output distribution)
* MSE loss (between averaged student and teacher hidden states)

The key features are:
* unlike most of distilled language models, we **didn't** use KL loss during pre-training
* reduced vocabulary size (30K in *tiny* vs. 100K in *base* and *small* )
* two separate inputs for student: tokens obtained using student tokenizer (for MLM) and teacher tokens greedily splitted by student tokens (for MSE)

Here is comparison between teacher model (`Conversational RuBERT`) and other distilled models.

|---|---|---|---|
| `rubert-base-cased-conversational` | 177.9 | 120 | 679 |
| `distilrubert-base-cased-conversational` | 135.5 | 120 | 517 |

DistilRuBERT-tiny was trained for about 100 hrs. on 7 nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.

We used `PyTorchBenchmark` from `transformers` to evaluate model's performance and compare it with other pre-trained language models for Russian. All tests were performed on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz and nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.

To evaluate model quality, we fine-tuned DistilRuBERT-tiny on classification (RuSentiment, ParaPhraser), NER and question answering data sets for Russian and obtained scores very similar to the [Conversational DistilRuBERT-small](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/distilrubert-tiny-cased-conversational).
