# distilrubert-base-cased-conversational
Conversational DistilRuBERT \(Russian, cased, 6‑layer, 768‑hidden, 12‑heads, 135.4M parameters\) was trained on OpenSubtitles\[1\], [Dirty](https://d3.ru/), [Pikabu](https://pikabu.ru/), and a Social Media segment of Taiga corpus\[2\] (as [Conversational RuBERT](https://huggingface.co/DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-conversational)).

Our DistilRuBERT was highly inspired by \[3\], \[4\]. Namely, we used 
* KL loss (between teacher and student output logits)
* MLM loss (between tokens labels and student output logits)
* Cosine embedding loss between mean of two consecutive hidden states of the teacher and one hidden state of the student

The model was trained for about 100 hrs. on 8 nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.

To evaluate improvements in the inference speed, we ran teacher and student models on random sequences with seq_len=512, batch_size = 16 (for throughput) and batch_size=1 (for latency). 
All tests were performed on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20GHz and nVIDIA Tesla P100-SXM2.0 16Gb.
