# T5-base pre-trained on cleaned Dutch mC4 ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

A [T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) v1.1 base model pre-trained from scratch on [Dutch mC4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yhavinga/mc4_nl_cleaned). This model achieves an evaluation accuracy of 0,78 and loss 0,96.

* Pre-trained T5 models need to be finetuned before they can be used for downstream tasks, therefore the inference widget on the right has been turned off.
* For a fine-tuned version for summarization, see [yhavinga/t5-v1.1-base-dutch-cnn-test](https://huggingface.co/yhavinga/t5-v1.1-base-dutch-cnn-test).
* For a demo of the Dutch CNN summarization models, head over to the Hugging Face Spaces for
the **[Netherformer ðŸ“°](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/netherformer)** example application!

## Tokenizer

* SentencePiece tokenizer trained from scratch for Dutch on mC4 nl cleaned with scripts from the Huggingface
  Transformers [Flax examples](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/flax/language-modeling).

## Dataset

All models listed below are trained on of the `full` configuration (39B tokens) of
[cleaned Dutch mC4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yhavinga/mc4_nl_cleaned),
which is the original mC4, except

  * Documents that contained words from a selection of the Dutch and English [List of Dirty Naught Obscene and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words) are removed
  * Sentences with less than 3 words are removed
  * Sentences with a word of more than 1000 characters are removed
  * Documents with less than 5 sentences are removed
  * Documents with "javascript", "lorum ipsum", "terms of use", "privacy policy", "cookie policy", "uses cookies",
    "use of cookies", "use cookies", "elementen ontbreken", "deze printversie" are removed.
 
## Models

TL;DR: [yhavinga/t5-v1.1-base-dutch-cased](https://huggingface.co/yhavinga/t5-v1.1-base-dutch-cased) is the best model.

* `yhavinga/t5-base-dutch` is a re-training of the Dutch T5 base v1.0 model trained during the summer 2021
  Flax/Jax community week. Accuracy was improved from 0.64 to 0.70.
* The two T5 v1.1 base models are an uncased and cased version of `t5-v1.1-base`, again pre-trained from scratch on Dutch,
  with a tokenizer also trained from scratch. The t5 v1.1 models are slightly different from the t5 models, and the 
  base models are trained with a dropout of 0.0. For fine-tuning it is intended to set this back to 0.1.
* The large cased model is a pre-trained Dutch version of `t5-v1.1-large`. Training of t5-v1.1-large proved difficult. 
  Without dropout regularization, the training would diverge at a certain point. With dropout training went better,
  be it much slower than training the t5-model. At some point convergance was too slow to warrant further training.
  The latest checkpoint, training scripts and metrics are available for reference. For actual fine-tuning the cased
  base model is probably the better choice.
