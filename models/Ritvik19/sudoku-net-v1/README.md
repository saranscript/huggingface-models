## Overview
Sudoku Net V1 model solves sudoku puzzles. It was developed to see the performance of machine learning applications on solving sudokus.
This model is trained on [1 million Sudoku games](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku) dataset provided on kaggle by [Kyubyong Park](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark)

## Usage
The Huggingface Hub architecture currently does not support inference from this model since it is unable to determine this modelâ€™s pipeline type. Thus, it is recommended to use as easy-to-use PyPI package [ai-sudoku-solver](https://pypi.org/project/ai-sudoku-solver/).
The package can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ritvik19/ai-Sudoku-Solver)

```bash
pip install ai-sudoku-solver
```

Instantiate a SudokuSolver object

```python
from ai_sudoku_solver import SudokuSolver

solver = SudokuSolver("Ritvik19/sudoku-net-v1")
```

Call the model on your puzzles

```python
puzzle = np.array([[
    [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 3],
    [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 7],
    [1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 8, 6, 9, 0],
    [0, 4, 2, 9, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0]
]])
solution = solver(puzzle)
# array([[
#     [8, 6, 4, 3, 7, 1, 2, 5, 9],
#     [3, 2, 5, 8, 4, 9, 7, 6, 1],
#     [9, 7, 1, 2, 6, 5, 8, 4, 3],
#     [4, 3, 6, 1, 9, 2, 5, 8, 7],
#     [1, 9, 8, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 2],
#     [2, 5, 7, 4, 8, 3, 9, 1, 6],
#     [6, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5],
#     [7, 1, 3, 5, 2, 8, 6, 9, 4],
#     [5, 4, 2, 9, 1, 6, 3, 7, 8]
# ]])
