# Plant Disease Detection Inference Interface

This is the inference interface of my plant disease detecion model.

You can download a copy of the pre-trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FVawQYsB31ByC1r9xG7JAajbOrpKVt04/view?usp=sharing)

## Set things up

First clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/JosiasAurel/plant-model.git
```

Move to the directory of the repo

```
cd plant-model
```

Make you have python 3 and pip installed correctly. Then run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all dependencies have been installed, run

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Now you can play around with the model ;)
