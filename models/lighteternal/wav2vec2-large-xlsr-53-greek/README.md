# Greek (el) version of the XLSR-Wav2Vec2 automatic speech recognition (ASR) model
### By the Hellenic Army Academy and the Technical University of Crete


* language: el
* licence: apache-2.0
* dataset: CommonVoice (EL), 364MB: https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/el/datasets + CSS10 (EL), 1.22GB: https://github.com/Kyubyong/css10
* model: XLSR-Wav2Vec2, trained for 50 epochs
* metrics: Word Error Rate (WER)

## Model description

UPDATE: We repeated the fine-tuning process using an additional 1.22GB dataset from CSS10.

Wav2Vec2 is a pretrained model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and was released in September 2020 by Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli, and Alex Conneau. Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on the English ASR dataset LibriSpeech, Facebook AI presented XLSR-Wav2Vec2. XLSR stands for cross-lingual speech representations and refers to XLSR-Wav2Vec2`s ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.

Similar to Wav2Vec2, XLSR-Wav2Vec2 learns powerful speech representations from hundreds of thousands of hours of speech in more than 50 languages of unlabeled speech. Similar, to BERT's masked language modeling, the model learns contextualized speech representations by randomly masking feature vectors before passing them to a transformer network.

This model was trained on Greek CommonVoice speech data (364MB) for 60 epochs on a single NVIDIA RTX 3080, for aprox. 8hrs.

## How to use for inference:

For live demo, make sure that speech files are sampled at 16kHz.

Instructions to test on CommonVoice extracts are provided in the ASR_Inference.ipynb. Snippet also available below:

## Evaluation

The model can be evaluated as follows on the Greek test data of Common Voice. 


```python
import torch
import torchaudio
from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor
import re

test_dataset = load_dataset("common_voice", "el", split="test") 
wer = load_metric("wer")

processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained("lighteternal/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-greek") 
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained("lighteternal/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-greek")
model.to("cuda")

chars_to_ignore_regex = '[\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\?\\\\\\\\.\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\-\\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\\:\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\‚Äú\\\\\\\\%\\\\\\\\‚Äò\\\\\\\\‚Äù\\\\\\\\ÔøΩ]'
resampler = torchaudio.transforms.Resample(48_000, 16_000)

# Preprocessing the datasets.
# We need to read the aduio files as arrays

def speech_file_to_array_fn(batch):
  batch["sentence"] = re.sub(chars_to_ignore_regex, '', batch["sentence"]).lower()
  speech_array, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load(batch["path"])
  batch["speech"] = resampler(speech_array).squeeze().numpy()
  return batch
  
test_dataset = test_dataset.map(speech_file_to_array_fn)

# Preprocessing the datasets.
# We need to read the aduio files as arrays

def evaluate(batch):
  inputs = processor(batch["speech"], sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
  with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(inputs.input_values.to("cuda"), attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask.to("cuda")).logits
  pred_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
  batch["pred_strings"] = processor.batch_decode(pred_ids)
  return batch

result = test_dataset.map(evaluate, batched=True, batch_size=8)
print("WER: {:2f}".format(100 * wer.compute(predictions=result["pred_strings"], references=result["sentence"])))
```

**Test Result**: 10.497628 %
