# End-to-end SLU model for SLURP

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform Speech to intent and slot label with a fine-tuned hubert encoder + decoder using SpeechBrain (in E2E trend). 
It is trained on [SLUR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13205) training data.


For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The model performance on SLURP test set is:

| Release | SLU-F1(%) | 
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 30-11-21 | 75.10 | 


## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform SLU E2E decoding

An external `py_module_file=custom_interface.py` is used as an external Predictor class into this HF repos. We use `foreign_class` function from `speechbrain.pretrained.interfaces` that allow you to load you custom model. 

```python
>>> from speechbrain.pretrained.interfaces import foreign_class
>>> slu = foreign_class(source="speechbrain/SLU-direct-SLURP-hubert-enc",  pymodule_file="custom_interface.py", classname="CustomSLUDecoder")
>>> slu.decode_file("speechbrain/SLU-direct-SLURP-hubert-enc/audio-1490356700-headset.flac")
```

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *decode_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *decode_batch* and *decode_batch*.

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (aa018540).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/SLURP/direct
python train_with_wav2vec2.py hparams/train_with_wav2vec2.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LpcuFldRo_Va1OCGp1bLNdiaC7AQNJOb?usp=sharing)).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
