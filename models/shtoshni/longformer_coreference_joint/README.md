Longformer-large model finetuned for the coreference resolution task. The model is fine-tuned over a mixture of OntoNotes, LitBank, and PreCo. The model is released as part of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09667.pdf). Note that the document encoder is to be used with the rest of the model parameters to perform the coreference resolution task. For demo purposes, please check this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11ejXc1wDqzUxpgRH1nLvqEifAX30Z71_?usp=sharing).
